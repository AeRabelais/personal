## Ethical Framework

I use my ethical framework as a tool for making major decisions about my philosophy, research, and advocacy that I believe will be of the most significant benefit to humanity. The composition of my ethical framework assumes that cooperation (or collectivism) is the most pragmatic system of living, and consists of three defined, oftentimes interloping tenets, those being:

**An Egalitarian and Ecology-based Land Ethic**

**Deep Ecology Worldview**

**Solutions-Based Justice**
