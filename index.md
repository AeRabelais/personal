## Ethical Framework

My ethical framework works as a tool for molding the form of my philosophy, research, and advocacy in a way that will be of the most significant benefit to humanity. The composition of my framework assumes that cooperation (or collectivism) is the most pragmatic system of living, and consists of three defined tenets those being:

**An Egalitarian and Ecology-based Land Ethic**

I believe all life and land holds an inherent worth, and that decisions made regarding the benefit of humanity must include consideration of the ecosystems that envelope said human population. By postulating that all life holds inherent worth, I also posit that all life deserves equal access to land, water, and the crucial resources produced by our immediate environment. People are best thought of as a layer in a larger biotic community, where each layer requires maintenance, care, and resources for their proliferation. 

**Deep Ecology Worldview**

The defining characteristics of deep ecology are nicely described by its Wikipedia entry: 

"_Deep ecology's core principle is the belief that the living environment as a whole should be respected and regarded as having certain basic moral and legal rights to live and flourish, independent of its instrumental benefits for human use._"

**Solutions-Based Justice**

I believe both long-term sociopolitical or technological advance and short-term immediate, accessible relief must coexist to create the most effective solution for systemic change. One is nearly meaningless without the other. What sense does it make to give aid without trying to fix the problem in the long run, and what sense does it make trying to fix the problem if those that needed your help are already dead?


## Interests
What do I spend my time thinking about?

### Research Interests

-  how the ability to more efficiently translate large sums of data will transform the way we undertake investigation in the sciences
-  how the tools of computational physics can create sustainable, cost-efficient improvements to medical processes and environmental architecture. 
-  how artifical ionization can create more efficient energy outcomes globally
-  how software engineering can improve and evaluate the sustainability efforts of environmental engineering
-  bioarchitecture and design

### Advocacy Interests

-  environmental injustice
-  open education and equitable knowledge access
-  science communication 
-  health inequity
-  right to privacy

### Personal Interests

-  Go (or Baduk)
-  General Entomology (with a softspot for roaches and arachnids)
-  Books, primarily by Russians or absurd people, and likely about bugs or moral ambiguity
-  Computerstuff 
-  Linguistics
-  Artsy Fartsy Activities
